# BTODemand
This repo houses my masters thesis which studies the effects of the Prime Location Housing reform on speculative housing demand in Singapore. 

It includes 
1) instructions on how to create a panel dataset of BTO application rates from 2010-2025 via webscraping and geopandas merge
2) causal forest difference in difference analysis
3) machine learning predictor for housing demand (BTO application rate)
